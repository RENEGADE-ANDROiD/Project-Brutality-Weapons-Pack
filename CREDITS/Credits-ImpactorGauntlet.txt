Impactor Gauntlet v1.1 for Project Brutality v3.0

Original Author: TheDoomedArchvile
Original Location: Realm667
Ported to Project Brutality by: Gemini0
Animations enhanced by: Icon Of Sin

Description: The Impactor Gauntlet was created with the aim to give space marines
a perminent powerful melee weapon in case they run out of ammo. This heavy beast
packs a serious punch which can knock back some foes when up close. This weapon also
includes a boost thruster which allows the wearer to speed forward a ways to
cross gaps and hit enemies multiple times, but deals significantly less damage.
With careful timing, the primary fire can even punch away projectiles!

Changelog:

	v1.0:
		Initial "full" release. The gauntlet was given new animations and a new sound, and steps were taken towards general improvements.

	v1.1:
		Revision made shortly after v1.0. Added kick/knife animations, and fixed the Berserk speed-up.
		Also, damage type changed to "ExtremePunches"... Not that it does anything.
